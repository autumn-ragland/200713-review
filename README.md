## CSS Positioning Review
- Create four divs of varying colors
- Position first div stick to top of screen when scrolling using position sticky
- Position second div to top right corner of the window using position fixed and move it visually behind all other divs using the z-index
- Position the third div 5% to the right of it's current position using position relative
- Create a fifth div and nest the fourth div inside
- Position the fourth div in the top left corner of the fifth div by position the fifth div then position the fourth div using position absolute

## CSS Pseudo Class
- Add a link in the first div that goes to google.com
- Style the link to be larger using font-size and black using color
- Style the link color to be white when it is hovered over using the pseudo class `:hover`
- Style the link color to be blue when it has already been clicked using the pseudo class `:visited`
